# Simple Server-Side Timer Fix

## Problem Fixed
Orders in "preparing" status were not automatically transitioning to "in_transit" when users navigated away from the dashboard page, causing orders to appear stuck in preparation.

## Simple Solution
Added a minimal server-side scheduled command that runs every minute to check for expired preparation timers and automatically move orders to "in_transit" status.

## What Was Changed

### 1. New Scheduled Command
- **File**: `app/Console/Commands/ProcessExpiredBatchTimers.php`
- **Purpose**: Simple timer that runs every minute to process expired preparation timers
- **What it does**: Finds orders in "preparing" status, checks if 61 seconds have passed, and moves them to "in_transit"

### 2. Updated Console Routes
- **File**: `routes/console.php` 
- **Added**: `Schedule::command('orders:process-expired-batches')->everyMinute();`

### 3. Simplified Dashboard Component
- **File**: `app/Livewire/Order/Dashboard.php`
- **Removed**: Complex queue logic that was causing new orders to show as "waiting"
- **Simplified**: Delivery status logic to only check for actual busy delivery persons

## Setup Instructions

### For Production (Recommended)
Add this to your system's cron tab:
```bash
* * * * * cd /path/to/your/project && php artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1
```

### For Development Testing
Run this command in a separate terminal:
```bash
php artisan schedule:work
```

### Manual Testing
Test the command manually:
```bash
php artisan orders:process-expired-batches
```

## How It Works

1. **Client-side**: Dashboard still polls every second for real-time updates when users are viewing the page
2. **Server-side**: Scheduled command runs every minute, regardless of user activity
3. **Timer Logic**: Both systems use the same 61-second timer duration
4. **No Conflicts**: Simple logic prevents any conflicts between the two systems

## Test the Fix

1. Create a new order and assign a delivery person
2. Click "Deliver" - order should show as "preparing" with countdown
3. Navigate to another page and wait 61+ seconds
4. Return to dashboard - order should now be "in_transit"
5. New orders should show "Deliver" button (not "waiting" or "queue")

## Benefits
- ✅ Orders automatically transition even when users are away
- ✅ No more stuck "preparing" orders
- ✅ New orders show as available for delivery (no false queue status)
- ✅ Simple, reliable solution with minimal complexity
- ✅ Real-time updates still work when on dashboard
