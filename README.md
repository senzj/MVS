# MVS (Modern Vendor System)
This system is all about my coding project for a small chinese grocery business store managment POS system that list down the products and their prices, manages employees to delivery orders, and order tracking and management system.

This project will serve as my coding challenge to further improve my knowledge and skills on Laravel and Livewire.
